- Add very basic CLI commands to get stuff going at least
- Try various techniques for single stepping:
    Settings int3 on every source line in a function (take chunk of memory of the function and flush the whole thing - there is a size member in the symbol info)
    Analyse the dissassembly code for jumps etc...
