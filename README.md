# lGdb

A Windows C/C++ Debugger project which contains 3 things:

- An easy to use API for interfacing with Windows debugging utilities (code in `source/lgdb`)
- Debugger through a command line interface (code in `source/lgdbcli`)
- A test program (code in `source/lgdbtest`)
- (COMING SOON) Debugger through a graphical user interface (code in `source/lgdbgui`)
